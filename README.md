A simple tax calculator for freelancers working as sole traders (PFA) in Romania.

## Context

In the fall of 2023 the Romanian government adopted a set of new fiscal measures that will affect the income of freelancers working as sole traders (PFA).  
Among other things, the changes include a minimum fixed-amount health insurance contribution (CASS) of 6 x 10% of the minimum wage, regardless of the actual income of the freelancer; this means that in some cases the freelancer will end up paying more in taxes than they actually earn, which is undoubtedly immoral and probably illegal.
